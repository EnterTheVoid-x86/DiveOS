# DiveOS
The only Arch you'll ever need.

## What is DiveOS?
DiveOS is a Linux Distribution based off of Arch Linux. It's main goal is simplicity, efficency, and usability.
Everything is preconfigured for you to ensure the best Arch desktop setup you can have.

## Why Arch?

The main reason for an arch base is purely because it's easy.

## How can I get started?

You can download the ISO in the releases tab of github.

## What tools are used?
DiveOS's Window Manager is SWIM, a modified penrose designed to look not only elegant, but also provide a fully functional window manager. It is made in the Rust Programming Language.

DiveOS has an optional replacement to GNU Coreutils, which is BusyBox and FreeBox.
FreeBox is also made in rust, and is designed to try and make a fully functional Alpine system without GNU.

## What display protocol does SWIM use?
SWIM uses the X11 Display Protocol.
